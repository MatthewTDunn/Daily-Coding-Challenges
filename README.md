This repository is filled with my solutions to codewars challenges (kata) which are primarily focused in the languages of:
<br />
Javascript  
Python      
C#          

Currently Ranked in the top 11% on the global leaderboard with over 150 completed challenges (I endeavour to update these figures at the beginning of each month).

## How It's Made:

I make it a habit to push a Codewars challenge in at least one of my three focus languages each day, for a weekly push of 7 challenges minimum. 
Once complete, I extract the instructions, test case code & highlight my solution to each problem before pushing to Github.

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability. 

## Lessons Learned:

Building a habit out of challenging myself daily has highlighted to me how many different ways there are to solve a problem and that you can always push yourself to write cleaner, more readable & innovative code.
